                <p>Koninklijke Philips N.V. (lit.â€‰'Royal Philips'), commonly shortened to Philips, is a Dutch
                    multinational conglomerate corporation that was founded in Eindhoven in 1891. Since 1997, it has
                    been mostly headquartered in Amsterdam, though the Benelux headquarters is still in Eindhoven.
                    Philips was formerly one of the largest electronics companies in the world, but is currently focused
                    on the area of health technology, having divested its other divisions.

                    The company was founded in 1891 by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik, with their first products
                    being light bulbs. It currently employs around 80,000 people across 100 countries. The company
                    gained its royal honorary title (hence the Koninklijke) in 1998 and dropped the "Electronics" in its
                    name in 2013, due to its refocusing from consumer electronics to healthcare technology.

                    Philips is organized into three main divisions: Personal Health (formerly Philips Consumer
                    Electronics and Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care), Connected Care, and Diagnosis &
                    Treatment (formerly Philips Medical Systems). The lighting division was spun off as a separate
                    company, Signify N.V.

                    The company started making electric shavers in 1939 under the Philishave and Norelco brands, and
                    post-war they developed the Compact Cassette format and co-developed the Compact Disc format with
                    Sony, as well as numerous other technologies. As of 2012, Philips was the largest manufacturer of
                    lighting in the world as measured by applicable revenues.

                    Philips has a primary listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange and is a component of the
                    Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
                    Acquisitions include that of Signetics and Magnavox. It also founded a multidisciplinary sports club
                    called PSV Eindhoven in 1913.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <img src="./img/founder.jpg" alt="founder">
                <p>The Philips Company was founded in 1891, by Dutch-Jewish entrepreneur Gerard Philips and his father
                    Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in Zaltbommel, financed the purchase and setup of an
                    empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament
                    lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is
                    used as a museum.
                    In 1895, after a difficult first few years and near-bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in Anton,
                    Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton
                    started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important
                    business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the
                    founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in
                    Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips
                    Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding
                    the Philips corporation, they laid the foundations for the later multinational.</p>
